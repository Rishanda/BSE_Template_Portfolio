# Final Milestone
My final milestone is to add sound to the game so everytime it jump it makes a sound making it something like Mario .

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was to turn on the blacklight with the uses of the wiring I had learnt in my first milestone. This was kind of contradicting because what I had learnt in the first milestrone was not working so had to had to change the wiring.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up the wires on the board and on the uno circuit. When I soldiered the jumper wires I had some diffculty getting it to work, it kept flashing.In the end I had to blacklight.
